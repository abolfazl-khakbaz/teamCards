## ðŸ”’ Disclaimer on Content

Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of freelance contracts, especially common among small businesses and startups, I was not allowed to publish the full project code originally.

However, as the institute has since closed and the original website is no longer live, Iâ€™ve shared a modified version of the project. Here's what I changed:

- **Instructor images** were replaced with placeholders
- **Some textual content** has been anonymized or rewritten
- **Sensitive client-specific content** was removed or adapted

The code and structure remain true to the original project and are presented here to showcase my front-end development skills in a real-world context.
